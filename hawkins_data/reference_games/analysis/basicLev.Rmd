This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
setwd("~/Repos/reference_games/analysis")

basicLevData = read.csv("../data/basicLevelReference/basiclev_manModified.csv")
basicCombined <- basicLevData %>%
  mutate(numRawWords = 1 + str_count(speakerMessages, fixed(" "))) %>%
  mutate(strippedContents = str_replace_all(speakerMessages, "[^[:alnum:][:space:]']",' ')) %>%
  do(mutate(., cleanMsg = rm_stopwords(.$strippedContents, tm::stopwords("english"), 
                                       separate = F))) %>%
  mutate(numCleanWords = 1 + str_count(cleanMsg, fixed(" "))) %>%
  mutate(numCleanChars = nchar(as.character(cleanMsg))) %>%
  filter(numRawWords < mean(numRawWords) + 2*sd(numRawWords)) %>% # Get rid of outliers
  select(gameid, time, roundNum, condition, numCleanWords, numCleanChars, cleanMsg)

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
convMod = lmer(numCleanWords ~ roundNum * condition + (1 + condition | gameid),
     data = basicCombined %>% 
    group_by(gameid, roundNum) %>%
    filter(row_number()==1))
summary(convMod)

ggplot(basicCombined %>% 
    group_by(gameid, roundNum) %>%
    filter(row_number()==1) %>%
    group_by(roundNum, condition) %>% 
    summarize(meanNumWords = mean(numCleanWords),
              meanNumChars = mean(numCleanChars)),
  aes(x = roundNum, y = meanNumChars, color = condition)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(span = 2) +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("Do people use fewer chars?")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
