# Recursive Neural RSA

This is an implementation of Jacob Andreas's neural RSA model but with multiple recursions. Our primary goal is to test if the literal listener and speaker are encoding pragmatic data. Specifically, we create a reasoning (recursive) speaker and listener to enable multiple levels of recurison in RSA. This allows us to test if Neural RSA gets better with multiple recursions as classic (bayesian) RSA does.
